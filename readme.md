# AVR ATmega8 Charge Controller

An AVR ATmega8 based charge controller for wind and solar charging of a lead-acid battery (work in progress)

## Todo

- Affects of cpu freq. on power consumption
- PWM charging?
- Voltage measurement averages (based on millis or clock cycles or soomething)
- Optimise Makefile
- Lead acid battery charging algorithm?
- Schematic
- License
